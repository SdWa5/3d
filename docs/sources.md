# Sources

Where each device's numbers come from. Every spec's `provenance` and `clone_of.reference` point at a
row here, so a number can always be traced back to something — or visibly to nothing.

Keep this in step with the specs. It is the difference between "0.573 m wide" and "0.573 m wide
*because the design's CAD mesh says so*".

Drive paths are relative to the **SdWa5** Shared Drive, folder
`Hardware/Speaker Enclosures _ Lautsprecher-Gehäuse/`.

### Still unsourced

Two weights are **estimates**, not measurements or published figures — `eighteensound-2way-15`
(30 kg) and `achenbach-18` (50 kg). Neither appears in any spreadsheet or datasheet. Both are noted
in their specs and belong on the measuring list in [measuring.md](measuring.md).

### Not owned

`PA-Gehaeuse_Vergleich_und_Effizienzberechnung.xlsx` also carries SKHORN, GHORN and OTHORN with
full dimensions and weights. Those were **evaluated, not bought** — only SKRAM was built. They are
deliberately absent from `specs/`; if one is ever acquired, the spreadsheet already has its numbers.

## What counts as a source

| `reference` | Means |
|-------------|-------|
| `datasheet` | a published spec sheet — the original manufacturer's, or for factory gear its own |
| `plans` | the build plans or cut list the cabinet was made from |
| `cad` | a published CAD/3D model of the design |
| `none` | nothing yet; the numbers are measured or guessed |

## Licensing

Only relevant for `mesh_override`, and only ever for models we did **not** generate:

* Everything the builder produces is our own geometry, generated from measurements or published
  dimensions. Dimensions are facts about an object, not a creative work.
* The CAD files in Drive (`subwoofer v28.obj`, `Achenbach 18.FCStd`, the 18sound `.FCStd`) are other
  people's work. Using them as a `mesh_override` means checking their licence first and recording it
  here. They are fine as a *dimension reference* either way.
* Nothing binary is committed to this repository — `build/` is ignored — so a `mesh_override` mesh
  lives outside it and is referenced by path. A third-party licence question can therefore never
  become a question about this repo's history.
